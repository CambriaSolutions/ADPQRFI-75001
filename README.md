##U.S. Digital Services Playbook
Here's how we incorporated the 13 plays:

# The Cambria Way
Cambria builds custom-tailored solutions using ingenuity and a distinctly humanized approach. Something we like to call HumanGenuityÂ®. What better way for us to demonstrate how we put this into practice than by engaging in a challenge to develop a human-centered prototype while displaying our agile approach!

# Our Human-Centered Approach 
"Customer collaboration over contract negotiation"

The required components: 1) establish and manage foster parent profile 2) view children's residential facilities in parent's zip code 3) and communicate with the case worker via private inbox. 

While the key prototype requirements were clear and straightforward, we reached beyond the basics to create a user experience that was intuitive to the needs of actual foster parents and case workers and included user relevant features for every page. We incorporated our users and SMEs from day one, starting with discovery, and conducted usability testing continuously with each iteration. We also researched related resources and government reports. With this collective knowledge, we developed personas to further define and personalize the prototype's core characteristics. 

# Agile in Action 
*"Individuals and interactions over processes and tools"*

Over the last three weeks, our cross-functional team met face-to-face in conference rooms, spent hours in break out meetings, and collaborated daily in scrums to develop a prototype that exemplifies not only our technical and agile skills but the human-centered design principles. 

*"Working software over comprehensive documentation"*

*"Responding to change over following a plan"*

To get to the goal of a working prototype in the time we were given, we started developing our first user story just as soon as our user group agreed on it. We learned a lot in the first sprint and never stopped learning, iterating, evolving, and adapting until we were done with our sixth sprint. We tested each core feature and made adjustments based on raised issues and feedback from our regular sprint retrospectives. From fixing bugs and issues to tweaking wireframes and visual design to adjusting the software stack, every aspect of each lifecycle was open to adjustments to ensure the prototype functioned and responded the way our users needed it to.   


# Requirements for the Prototype

1. After we qualified the opportunity, our executive team met and assigned a leader, Dhiraj, to lead this initiative. Dhiraj was given the authority to lead the prototype development and to ensure that we deliver a quality product to OSI. Dhiraj is a certified Professional Scrum Master and he also served as the Agile Coach for the team. [Link to Team](/artifacts/The%20Team.pdf)

2. Dhiraj enlisted Anand, a Cambria executive, to help him crowdsource a multi-disciplinary team. Anand reached out to all Cambrianites via an email and they responded. The team assembled represented diverse backgrounds, including a few working remotely. We gathered developers, designers, business analysts, subject matter experts, and policy consultants. Based on the varied skills and interests, the team quickly organized itself. Individuals aligned themselves to relevant roles. These roles included: Product Manager, Technical Architect, Interaction Designer/Usability Tester, Writer/Content Strategist, Visual Designer, Front-End Web Developer, Back-End Web Developer, DevOps Engineer, Delivery Manager, Agile Coach, Business Analysts, and Users.
