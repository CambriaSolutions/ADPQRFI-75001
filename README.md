# The Cambria Way
Cambria builds custom-tailored solutions using ingenuity and a distinctly humanized approach. Something we like to call HumanGenuity®. What better way for us to demonstrate how we put this into practice than by engaging in a challenge to develop a human-centered prototype while displaying our agile approach! 

# Our Human-Centered Approach 
*"Customer collaboration over contract negotiation"*

The required components: 1) establish and manage foster parent profile 2) view children's residential facilities in parent's zip code 3) and communicate with the case worker via private inbox. 

While the key prototype requirements were clear and straightforward, we reached beyond the basics to create a user experience that was intuitive to the needs of actual foster parents and case workers and included user relevant features for every page. We incorporated our users and SMEs from day one, starting with discovery, and conducted usability testing continuously with each iteration. We also researched related resources and government reports. With this collective knowledge, we developed personas to further define and personalize the prototype's core characteristics. 

# Agile in Action 
*"Individuals and interactions over processes and tools"*

Over the last three weeks, our cross-functional team met face-to-face in conference rooms, spent hours in break out meetings, and collaborated daily in scrums to develop a prototype that exemplifies not only our technical and agile skills but the human-centered design principles. 

*"Working software over comprehensive documentation"*

*"Responding to change over following a plan"*

To get to the goal of a working prototype in the time we were given, we started developing our first user story just as soon as our user group agreed on it. We learned a lot in the first sprint and never stopped learning, iterating, evolving, and adapting until we were done with our sixth sprint. We tested each core feature and made adjustments based on raised issues and feedback from our regular sprint retrospectives. From fixing bugs and issues to tweaking wireframes and visual design to adjusting the software stack, every aspect of each lifecycle was open to adjustments to ensure the prototype functioned and responded the way our users needed it to.   

# U.S. Digital Services Playbook
We followed the Digital Services Playbook and created a *[[document]](/artifacts/US%20Digital%20Serices%20Playbook%20Checklist.pdf)* describing our plays and our adherance to them. of our plays.

# Requirements for the Prototype

(a)

After we qualified the opportunity, our executive team met and assigned a leader, Dhiraj, to lead this initiative. Dhiraj was given the authority to lead the prototype development and to ensure that we deliver a quality product to OSI. Dhiraj is a certified Professional Scrum Master and he also served as the Agile Coach for the team. *[[Our Team]](/artifacts/The%20Team.pdf)*

(b)

Dhiraj enlisted Anand, a Cambria executive, to help him crowdsource a multi-disciplinary team. Anand reached out to all Cambrianites via an email and they responded. The team assembled represented diverse backgrounds, including a few working remotely. We gathered developers, designers, business analysts, subject matter experts, and policy consultants. Based on the varied skills and interests, the team quickly organized itself. Individuals aligned themselves to relevant roles. These roles included: Product Manager, Technical Architect, Interaction Designer/Usability Tester, Writer/Content Strategist, Visual Designer, Front-End Web Developer, Back-End Web Developer, DevOps Engineer, Delivery Manager, Agile Coach, Business Analysts, and Users. *[[Crowdsourcing]](/artifacts/Crowdsourcing.pdf)* *[[Our Team]](/artifacts/The%20Team.pdf)*

(c)

We determined that the best product could only be developed and designed by knowing, empathizing with, and understanding the user. As such, we assigned four of our staff to take on the user roles. We invited them to our initial discovery/user interaction meeting and encouraged their contribution. One of our users is a subject matter expert who also has personal experience with the foster care system. Her knowledge and personal story became a valuable resource as we worked to identify the target audience and their most pertinent needs for this application. *[[User Engagement]](/artifacts/User%20Engagement.pdf)* *[[Foster Parent Persona]](/artifacts/Persona%201-%20Monica.pdf)* *[[Case Worker Persona]](/artifacts/Persona%202-%20Charles.pdf)* *[[Our User Stories]](/artifacts/User%20Stories.md)*

(d)

In developing this prototype, we utilized several human-centered design techniques: (1) user stories, (2) personas, (3) user interviews, (4) rapid prototyping using wireframes, (5) screen design sketches, and (6) usability testing. *[[Our User Stories]](/artifacts/User%20Stories.md)* *[[Foster Parent Persona]](/artifacts/Persona%201-%20Monica.pdf)* *[[Case Worker Persona]](/artifacts/Persona%202-%20Charles.pdf)* *[[Our Human Centered Design]](/artifacts/Human%20Centered%20Design.pdf)* *[[Human Centered Design Artifacts]](/artifacts/Human-Centered-Design-Artifacts)* *[[Usability Testing]](/artifacts/Usability%20Testing.pdf)*

(e)

We developed our style guide keeping in mind its significant impact on the way users perceive and feel about their interactive experience and the brand itself. Because all the information is visually-presented, finding the right look and feel was essential. We prioritized the following objectives: the use of inspirational pictures, friendly and empathetic tone, persona-based branding, being intuitive and relevant, conversational nature, and presentation of the Cambria brand. *[[Style Guide]](/artifacts/Style%20Guide.pdf)* *[[Style Guide Process]](/artifacts/Human-Centered-Design-Artifacts/Style-Guide-Process/Style%20Guide%20%Process.pdf)*

(f)

Our Usability testing focused on understanding the users, their needs, and what they value. Our representative users, who were located in different geographical areas, became our testers and utilized a variety of devices and platforms. Based on their feedback, we noted enhancements as issues for every sprint, and used the information collected to evaluate the usability of the application, and recommended improvements with each successive sprint. The users began testing at the end of sprint 1 and continued throughout all subsequent sprints. *[[Our Sprints]](https://github.com/CambriaSolutions/ADPQRFI-75001/milestones?state=closed)* *[[Issues]](https://github.com/CambriaSolutions/ADPQRFI-75001/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed)* *[[Usability Testing]](/artifacts/Usability%20Testing.pdf)* *[[User Feedback]](/artifacts/User%20Feedback.pdf)*

(g)

We used an iterative approach, each sprint informing the subsequent. Our team conducted six sprints corresponding with our user stories. Each sprint cycle began with a sprint planning meeting and ended with a sprint review and sprint retrospective meetings. We ran two-day sprints and held daily scrums to review the last 24 hours, the next 24 hours, and any impediments that the team might have had. The team started slow but soon picked up velocity and finished most of the development early with the last couple of sprints planned for addressing prioritized enhancements and issues. *[[Our Agile Process]](/artifacts/Agile%20Process.pdf)* *[[Our Agile Techniques]](/artifacts/Agile%Techniques.pdf)*

(h)

This prototype works on multiple devices including desktops, laptops, android and iOS phones and tablets. We conducted usability testing on various devices to ensure its ease of use and responsive design. *[[Responsive-Design]](/artifacts/Responsive-Design/)*

(i)

Modern software practices coincide with structured development methodology that is flexible enough to satisfy evolving needs. With this in mind, we built our solution on a foundation of modern open-source tools and technologies that facilitate collaboration between members of a cross-disciplinary team, as well as rapid prototyping and iteration without compromising the stability of the end-product. We used several open source technologies such as Flask, SQLite, PostgreSQL, Bootstrap, Pytest, and TravisCI. *[[Our Technology Stack]](/artifacts/Technology%20Stack.md)*

(j)

We used Heroku as our production PaaS provider because it allows us to focus on development while conveniently configuring and managing infrastructure needs. It also hosts our web server and Postgres database as well as minimizes effort without compromising control of and visibility into what's going on.
<<<<>>>>>>>>>>>

(k)

We chose to use Pytest for unit testing as it ensures logic is working as expected and regressions do not creep in. For functional tests, we used Webtest in order to simulate real user interactions with the website, which allowed us to incorporate testing feedback reducing the burden on the test team. *[[Automated Test Results]](/artifacts/Automated%20Test%20Results.png)*

(l)

We chose TravisCI for continuous integration, which enabled us to run tests in isolated container environments and deploy to Heroku all with a single 'git push' command. *[[Continuous Integration]](/artifacts/Continuous%20Integration.png)*

(m)

Git allowed us to share and collaborate on code and assets, while Github hosts our git repository and has collaboration and sprint/issue tracking features built in for productivity and project management needs. *[[Our Public Repository]](https://github.com/CambriaSolutions/ADPQRFI-75001)*

(n)

We used Librato for continuous monitoring because it is a complete solution that monitors and analyzes the metrics that impact the application at every level of the stack. We integrated Librato with Heroku to provide detailed information about the application’s performance. We added LogEntries to provide real-time logging, aggregated live-tail search and context views, and the ability to search events as they occur.
